# Hi Matthew and Elijah,

# Thank you so much for meeting with me to talk about the Program Manager role at Github. I enjoyed speaking with both of you and learning what you love about Github. I also appreciated hearing about the challenging projects you worked on, especially Github collections - it was impressive to launch a tool that supported so many programming languages at once!
