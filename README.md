# Hello Toni,
Thanks so much for speaking me with about the Program Manager role. I enjoyed learning more about the role and the success metrics around it. I also was very impressed with your “Ahoy” initiative and I applaud your efforts to improve the onboarding experience at Github. I hope to be able to partner with you in the quest to drive product and process improvements across the spectrum of Customer Support.
